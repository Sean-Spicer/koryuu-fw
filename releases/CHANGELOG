Changelog for the Koryuu firmware
=================================

Version 1.1-test0
-----------------
  Notes:
    - A public test version. May have bugs.
    - Asking for community feedback, especially regarding the NTSC
      interlaced mode field reversal issue some users were
      experiencing.

  Fixes:
    - Improved power-up sequence for the video chips.
    - Made transitions between interlaced and progressive modes more
      robust. The OSSC getting confused by Koryuu's output should no
      longer happen, as long as the OSSC firmware version is
      up-to-date (tested with OSSC firmware version 0.86).
    - Hopefully fixed field reversal in NTSC interlaced mode.
      - Feedback from those suffering from this problem with the
        release firmware is more than welcome.

  Not yet fixed:
    - The smoothing is still ugly, thus not very usable. :(

  General improvements:
    - Code cleanups and refactoring with no user-visible functional
      change.

  New features:
    - Separate firmware image (with the "_ntp" suffix), which disables
      video output when no input is detected.
    - Settings can now be saved and are automatically restored on
      power-up.
      - Uses the on-chip EEPROM.
      - Checksummed and versioned to allow firmware updates without
        losing current settings.
      - Saved settings:
        - Default input (Composite/S-Video)
	- Default input pedestal setting (on/off, corresponding to
          NTSC-M/J)
        - Smoothing (on/off)
        - Disable output when no input is detected (on/off)
          - Off by default (test pattern shown when no input).
          - Currently, changing this setting is not exposed, except
            by a separate firmware image with the _ntp suffix, which
            always disables output when no input is detected.
      - To save current settings, press the INPUT_CHANGE and OPT
        buttons simultaneously.
        - This is a bit timing-sensitive, which has been mitigated by
          requiring the buttons to be pressed a bit longer than before,
          but this requires careful balancing, as making the buttons
          any "laggier" may make the buttons feel unresponsive in other
          contexts. Any feedback regarding the "feel" of the buttons is
          welcome.
        - After hitting the button combo successfully, LEDs flash a few
          times.
        - On failure to hit the button combo, the input/pedestal
          setting and/or the smoothing setting changes, as if one or
          both of the buttons had been hit separately.

Version 1.0
-----------
  Notes:
    - Initial release. Release firmware for the Koryuu.
